# CODE-CLAUSE-GOLDEN-PROJECT
BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION USING KNN AND SVM MODELS
Since there have been more incidences of breast cancer in recent years, it is critical to make an early diagnosis in order to treat the disease 
and take preventative measures. The goal of this project is to create a Python-based system for the identification 
of breast cancer by processing the IDC (Invasive Ductal Carcinoma) dataset, which contains histology images of cancer-causing malignant cells. 
Convolution neural networks are used in this system to create the classification-based detection system
